### Goals for this workshop

- Demonstrate some patterns...
- ...and make `Redux` less scary in the process

### In version 1 we already have...

- Full app-redux split
- combined reducer
- separate service layer
- [Flux Standard Action](https://github.com/redux-utilities/flux-standard-action)
- action creators

### Notes

- Tiny example, doesn't really need Redux
- Poor error handling in UI (sorry)
- Unorthodoxness (sorry not sorry)
