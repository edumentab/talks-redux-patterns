/* REFAC|EDITCOMMENT
Because reducers for individual <span data-file-link="../../lib/types/action"><code>Actions</code></span> are now given directly to the <span data-file-link="../../lib/factory"><code>factory</code></span> instead, we delete this reducer and move the code into the action creators instead (in this case <span data-file-link="./actions/loadSetsInit"><code>loadSetsInit</code></span>, <span data-file-link="./actions/loadSetsSuccess"><code>loadSetsSuccess</code></span>, <span data-file-link="./actions/loadSetsError"><code>loadSetsError</code></span>, <span data-file-link="./actions/loadThemesInit"><code>loadThemesInit</code></span>, <span data-file-link="./actions/loadThemesSuccess"><code>loadThemesSuccess</code></span> and <span data-file-link="./actions/loadThemesError"><code>loadThemesError</code></span>).

The <span data-file-link="../../rootReducer"><code>rootReducer</code></span> - instead of being made up by a combination of <span data-file-link="../guessingGame/reducer"><code>guessingGameReducer</code></span>, `rebrickableReducer` and <span data-file-link="../ui/reducer"><code>uiReducer</code></span> - will now simply call the `reducer` in the given action.
