/* REFAC|EDITCOMMENT
The <span data-file-link="./loadThemesThunk"><code>loadThemesThunk</code></span> side effects have now moved to be a <span data-file-link="../../../lib/types/consequence"><code>Consequence</code></span> of <span data-file-link="../actions/loadThemesInit"><code>loadThemesInit</code></span>, and thus these tests are now covered in <span data-file-link="../actions/loadThemesInit.test"><code>loadThemesInit.test</code></span>.

Similarly <span data-file-link="./loadSetsForThemeThunk"><code>loadSetsForThemeThunk</code></span> was moved into <span data-file-link="../actions/loadSetsInit"><code>loadSetsInit</code></span>.
