          Is Redux slightly scary? Or you've wrapped your brain around it, but
          think of it as verbose and boilerplaty? Maybe you just want to get
          inspired on how to use it and what's possible? If the answer to any of
          these questions is yes, then this workshop/lecture is for you!
        </p>

        <p>
          Together we will explore the source code of a small example React
          application that consumes a backend API and uses Redux for state
          management. At the outset the setup is rather orthodox, which gives
          you a chance to get up to speed with a normal Redux setup.
        </p>

        <p>
          Then, as the workshop progresses, you will be taken through a series
          of increasingly unorthodox refactors. Our hope is that this will both
          provide you with new ideas and make you more comfortable with Redux in
          general!
        </p>
        <p>
          Special care will be given to the question of where to put our side
          effect code. We'll dissect
          <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk" target="_blank"
            >Redux Thunk</a
          >
          to see how it works, and then kick it out in favour of a better
          pattern (without having to go üçå with
          <a href="https://redux-observable.js.org/" target="_blank"
            >Redux Observables</a
          >
          or
          <a href="https://redux-saga.js.org/" target="_blank">Redux Sagas</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          While Redux is the focus, we'll also get the opportunity to talk about
          TypeScript concepts (to the extent that the audience so wishes). There
          will also be a fair bit of discussion around unit testing.

          This is an in-depth lecture/workshop for senior and knowledge-hungry
          JavaScript developers. The primary audience is teams that already use
          Redux and want to better themselves, but the contents can be tailored
          to also give a Redux introduction if needed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The minimal form is a ~2 hour lecture. To make for a more practical
          experience the lecture can be followed by a refactoring session where
          we help the team apply the patterns they've learned in their Redux
          codebase. This can extend the workshop all the way up to a full day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Not being as formal as one of our regular courses, the Redux workshop
          works very well as an inspirational evening seminar, or as an
          "exploration day" serving both as entertainment and competence
          development.
        </p>
