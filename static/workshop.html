      <h1>Redux Patterns</h1>
      <p>
        Are you among those who find that Redux a bit scary? Or you've made your
        peace with it, but find it a bit verbose and boilerplaty? Maybe you just
        want to be a bit inspired regarding how to use it and what's possible?
        If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then this workshop is
        for you!
      </p>

      <p>
        In the workshop we will explore a small example React application that
        consumes a backend API and uses Redux for state management. At the
        outset the setup is rather orthodox, which gives you a chance to get up
        to speed with a normal Redux setup.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then, as the workshop progresses, you will be taken through a series of
        increasingly unorthodox refactors. Our hope is that this will both
        provide you with new ideas, and make you more comfortable with Redux in
        general!
      </p>
      <p>
        While Redux is the focus, we'll also get the opportunity to talk about
        TypeScript concepts (to the extent that the audience so wishes). There
        will also be a fair bit of discussion around unit testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The workshop can be a simple 1-2 hour lecture, or be extended to include
        code-along. If you have a Redux codebase ripe for improving and/or
        experimenting, it could also be rewarding to end the workshop with a
        refactoring session where we help you employ the discussed patterns.
